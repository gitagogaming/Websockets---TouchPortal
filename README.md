## TouchPortal WebSocket Plugin

This plugin allows TouchPortal to connect to a WebSocket & send a message, as well as processing responses.

### Description
In its current form, the plugin is very basic. When the user sends a message, it initiates a connection to the websocket, sends the message, reveives the response then disconnected immediately after.

By leveraging this plugin, you can extend the functionality of TouchPortal, allowing for a more interactive and customized experience.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!
